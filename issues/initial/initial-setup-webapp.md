# Initial Setup Webapp

- Handy imports:
    - Add a `.env` file with `NODE_PATH=src` so that you can import with absolute path. TODO: but check the error: "Setting NODE_PATH to resolve modules absolutely has been deprecated in favor of setting baseUrl in jsconfig.json (or tsconfig.json if you are using TypeScript) and will be removed in a future major release of create-react-app."

# Pitch Guidelines

30 seconds:
1. What does your company do? We are Airbnb, we allow you to rent out the extra room in your house. (not we are a marketplace for space).
2. How big is the market? we are in the hotel-market, vacation rental market, online hotel booking market; which is a multi billion dollar market. (don't skip this)
3. How much traction do you have? We launched in January and we growing 30% month over month, we have this number of sales, this amount of revenue and this number of users.

Convince you are moving fast: in January we started, 2 months later released a beta and 2 months later we went live.

2 minute pitch:
1. the 30 second pith
2. unique insights: (you can tell the investor something he does not know; this is something the biggest players in the market don't do or don't understand - the aha moment). In 2 sentences; the intelligent idea, how to beat the competition.
3. how you make money: the business model; advertising? its okay. Direct sales? In app sales? Just 1 sentence. (don't say, maybe, or figure out, or we could do this this and that).
4. team: say what you did before to make investors money. If not, don't mention awards, phd's etc. Only: how many founders? how many technical and business? how you met? How long known each other? say you are working full time.
5. the big ask ($$$): you have to know what you are talking about. Are you raising on a convertible note? or on a safe, and what is its cap? how much money are you raising? Do the homework.

The attitude should be: this thing is moving, we all quit our job, we are working on it full-time, if you want to jump on, great, if not, there are lots of other investors. Show you are a fully committed team that is moving fast. Make sure you already launched and are growing.

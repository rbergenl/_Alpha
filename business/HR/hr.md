# HR Guidelines

> Source: iTunes University - Starting a Startup

First Job positions should be:
- Developer and designer with focus on building a great product and gathering user feedback to find product/market fit.

- Have someone for actually making sales and doing fundraising.
 
- Marketing & pr will not save the startup. Do marketing yourself: repeat the key message and get to 3/4 key journalists. Do not outsource to PR firm; journalists want to talk to the founder.

First Roles after 10+ employees:
- Position: Financial Planning & Analysis.
- Position: full time fundraising.
- Position: HR.

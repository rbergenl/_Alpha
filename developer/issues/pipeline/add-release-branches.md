# Add Release:Branches

> Make sure to finish *Setup Initial CICD* and that `GITLAB_TOKEN` is set.
> Releasing a branch is already automatically covered by the `.gitlan-ci.yml` file.

TODO
- TODO: npm publish (in cicd) -> only for UI and Base project.
- TODO: prerelease on all feature branches? (develop yes.. and feature based on `[release]`)

Prerelease:
- TODO: Add `[release]` to commit message in a feature branch. (how does this work with semantic-release?)

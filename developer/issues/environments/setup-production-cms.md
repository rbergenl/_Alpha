# Setup Production Environment for CMS

> The CMS is only deployed to a Test environment. Since it does not require Production performance.

## Do Householding

- Make sure to secure the Mongo Database on the Test environment, since it was set to allow all IP-addresses `0.0.0.0/0` since IP addresses from Heroku are dynamic (How to fix this?).

# Add basic documentation

- From *Project Alpha* copy/paste the `README.md`. Rename an already existing readme file (e.g. `README_cra.md`).
- From *Project Alpha* copy/paste the `docs/` folder when applicable (which contain an architecture diagram).
- Run `git add . && git commit -m "add docs" && git push`.
- In Gitlab at the Repo go to *Repository > Compare*. Select `develop` as source and `master` as target and click *Create merge request*. Then *Submit merge request*.
- Click *Modify merge commit* and add as first line `Closes #3`. (TODO: check this. Previous time added text to last line, and did not work).

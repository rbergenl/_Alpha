# Add Tag Management

A Tag Management System to manage all tool implementations (google tag manager, tealium)
-> This is actually already implemented with *Frontend > Analytics*.
But Tag Manager can do more? Should it include the libraries for Cookie Consent, A/B Testing, Retargeting, Feedback, Chat and Personalisation as well?

## Emailaddress
You need an email address to be able to create accounts for needed third party services. After deciding on a name and buying the domain, the email can be forwarded to this free and initial email address without being visible to others.
- Go to Google and create a new [account](https://accounts.google.com/signup) using the chosen name.
    - Use your real name. You can change this data when transfering the account later.
    - Use the chosen name for the email address (if needed suffix with a 1, 2, etc.).
    - Use a password generator and save it in your personal and browser password manager.
    - Verify with your real phonenumber.
    - Use your real date of birth and gender.
    - During Service Agreement, disable all services.
    - From the overview `myaccount.google.com`, remove your lastname for privacy reasons; and at *Personalisation* set the language to English.
- Get an isolated business environment by loggin into Google Chrome: click on the top right profile icon and `add` new person.

## Password Manager
All passwords for created accounts should be securely stored. An added benefit of using LastPass is an easy way to login to those accounts.
- Go to Lastpass and create a new [account](https://www.lastpass.com/).
- Signup with the project email. Also since your are logged into Google Chrome with the Google Account you can let Lastpass generate a password and have it stored in Chrome.
- Follow the instructions to install Lastpass as browser extension.
- Then login to that extension (you can find the password in Chrome > Settings > Passwords).
- Even though the LastPass Master Password is stored in the browser, still save it to your personal [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com).

## Creditcard
With [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) you get a free bank account and a virtual creditcard. This card can be used to create accounts which require a creditcard (like AWS). The Revolut app is connected to your personal data. And the card is only used for accounts creation, where actual payment will not occur (like Mailgunner).
    - Install the Revolut app.
    - Enter the phonenumber, a password and the received code.
    - Enter your real name and address.
    - Verify with your passport.
    - Topup the account with €10. Sometimes a creditcard verification process takes $1. You can topup the account using Apple Pay or a direct bank transfer.

### AWS Accounts
- You will create a root account and from that account you will create a Test and Production account.
    - Go to [AWS]((https://aws.amazon.com)). Click the button top right to Sign in and then click `Create a new AWS account`.
    - Choose *Professional* and enter your name, projectname, phonenumber, country, address, region, city and postal code. Full details are needed for creditcard verification.
    - Enter creditcard number, expiration date, your full name (In Revolut > Settings > Personal details) and use the provided address.
    - Follow the verify identity steps by entering your phonenumber again. If this fails, it is probably due to failed payment method verification:
        - Open the Revolut app and see a failed transaction from AWS. Make sure to topup Revolut account with €10.
        - Login to the AWS Console as the root user.
        - Go to the Billing Dashboard > Payment Details. For the creditcard click `verify`. If this does not work, click `edit` and make sure all details are entered and correct.
        - Do not forget to still finish the sign up steps: verify identity.
    - Select the support plan *Free*.

- Setup an AWS Organisation so you have two accounts, Test and Production.
    - Login as root user to console.aws.com.
    - Go to Organization and create a new account with email: `<projectname>+awstest@gmail.com`.
    - Note the account ID, then logout and go again to console.aws.com.
    - Login as root user (the provided email) to the noted account and `Forget password`.
    - Go to the emailbox and create a new password. This is the best practice to get started.
- For both AWS Accounts, create an Admin user.
- TODO: set 'permission boundaries' deny ec2, ecs and billing.

## Emailadress
You need an email adress to be able to create accounts for needed third party services. After deciding on a name and buying the domain, the email can be forwarded to this free and initial email address without being visible to others.
- Go to Google and create a new [account](https://accounts.google.com/signup) using the chosen name.
    - Use your real name. You can change this data when transfering the account later.
    - Use the chosen name for the email address (if needed suffix with a 1, 2, etc.).
    - Use a password generator and save it in your personal and browser password manager.
    - Verify with your real phonenumber.
    - Use your real date of birth and gender.
    - During Service Agreement, disable all services.
    - From the overview `myaccount.google.com`, remove your lastname for privacy reasons.

## Password Manager
Securely store the password.
- Go to Lastpass and create a new [account].
- TODO: finish this section..

### Creditcard
With [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) you get a free bank account and  a virtual creditcard. This card can be used to create accounts which require a creditcard (like AWS). The Revolut app is connected to your personal data. And the card is only used for accounts creation, where actual payment will not occur (like Mailgunner).
    - Install the Revolut app.
    - Enter the phonenumber, a password and the received code.
    - Enter your real name and address.
    - Verify with your passport.
    - Topup the account with â‚¬10. Sometimes a creditcard verification process takes $1. You can topup the account using Apple Pay or a direct bank transfer.
